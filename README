This is experimental code.  I'm not particularly proud of it; I just
wanted to see something working, and didn't have a lot of time.

This code implements

     http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/NOTE-rif-in-rdf-20110512/

In particular, the encoder and the decode were written at different
times, in different styles.   They should be merged into on module!

Try it:

# translate BLD example 8 into Turtle
python tr.py < test/bld-8.xml > out-bld-8.ttl

# extract the RIF document from that Turtle
python xtr.py out-bld-8.ttl > out-bld-8-loop.xml

# To compare, ignoring whitespace, etc
python xmldump.py < out-bld-8.xml > out-bld-8-loop.xdump
python xmldump.py < test/bld-8.xml > out-bld-8.xdump
diff out-bld-8-loop.xdump out-bld-8.xdump

(Observe that with the current code and data the xml:base declaration
in the BLD example gets lost.  That's okay, because we always write
out absolute URIs.)
